Project Title: Password Generator


Description:

1.  This is my take on the week three homework "Password Generator"

2.  This website allows the user to pick various specifications (uppercase, numbers and special chars.) for a secure password 

3.  For ease of use I added in a range slider to allow users to select what word count they need for their
    secure password. As well as checkboxes the allow uses to toggle what characters they want included.

4.  When you click the generate password button a secure, personalized password is displayed in the textbox placed at the center of the webpage
    after being generated by javascript in the backend.

5.  In the same folder this file is placed(ProjectDescription) in you can find an image of the working website.
